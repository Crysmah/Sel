This is Python script that uses Selenium to scrape data from Adorama.com, a PC parts website. The script is mainly searching for Radeon graphics card, but should be able to be changed
to look for whatever other products on Adorama. The output of the program is saved to a text file named output.txt.

The script can be changed to include the undetected chrome driver module to improve the script and made it more undetectable. Addition of proxies can be another improvement.

Dependencies
